# STEP_2: My 21 React apps + 1;
A project consists of 21 project !!

The first half of this phase i've learned React hooks, and in the other half i've practiced by 
creating 21 React app + 1 beside the small apps that i've built while i was learning. 


I've learned the hooks:
- useState
- useEffect
- useRef
- useContext
- useReducer 
- useContext
- useCallback

I've learned more about
- Forms
- Routing
<br />
<br />
<br />



## How to read the repo and compare my soluitions:
---
My code is written at the **setup** folder of each app, ther are also the **final** folder, which has the code that i was compare with, its written by the teacher by hemself **John smilga the good teacher**. 

You can see both directors and compare them or you can see my soluiton and how i think to solve a problem ..

be fare when you compare, they are my first 
codes that i wrote in React, So they may be not as good as i write React know :`))`;

Note: Since i grouped the all apps in one place in one project, I did some change to make it suitable
in its new environment LIKe using lazy load when you enter any app of the apps, changing absoluite paths to
relative paths, and so on ...
