# Step_2: My 21 React apps;
The first half of this phase i've learned React hooks, and in the other half i've practiced by creating 21 React apps beside the small apps
that i've built while i was learning.   
I've learned the hooks:
- useState
- useEffect
- useRef
- useContext
- useReducer 
- useContext
- useCallback
<br />

## Live demo of All Projects
[Projects Site (the main source)](https://react-projects.netlify.app/)

Note: I didn't deploy the projects on a server, you just can see my code and compare it with the final code
BUT to see the live demo, then see it from the main source :DD;

## How to read the repo and compare my soluitions:
My code is written at the **setup** folder of each app, threr are also the **final** folder, which has the code that i was compare with, its written by the teacher hemself **John smilga the good teacher**. You can see both directors and compare them or you can see my soluiton and how i think to solve a problem ..; be fare when you compare, it is my first 
codes that i wrote in React, So they may be not as good as i write React know :`))`;
